# Implementation and verification of a hardware-based controller for a three-phase induction motor on an FPGA

## Abstract

The aim of this thesis is to study the main techniques of motor control in order to implement and design a hardware-based controller for a three-phase induction motor, developed in VHDL language and running on an Artix-7 FPGA (Xilinx). This controller is based on variable-frequency drive techniques. The modules that define this controller's hardware description run concurrently to each other, and they allow the motor to have a better time response and they also improve its performance compared to a microcontroller. This thesis is related to digital systems, power electronics and control systems.
